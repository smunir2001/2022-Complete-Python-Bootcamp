## Introduction to Functions
Creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer.

__Functions__ allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times, without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code.

Functions will be a huge leap forward in your capabilities as a Python programmer.

This means that the problems you are able to solve can also be a lot harder!
## __Def__ keyword
Creating a function requires a very specific syntax, inncluding the __def__ keyword, correct indentation, and proper structure.
